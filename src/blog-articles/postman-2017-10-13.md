# API testing with Postman and Newman

A project that I have been working on recently involved creating an API written in NodeJS that would provide data for a separate application used by customer service staff members. It was essential that the data that this API return be very accurate as if it wasn't, it could potentially cost the company a lot of money that it otherwise wouldn't have to.

I wanted to not only have unit tests across this code, but be able to automatically run a suite of full stack tests whenever code was changed. To do this I decided to use a combination of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and an NPM package [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman)



### Here is some code

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  alert('Hello World');
}
```
